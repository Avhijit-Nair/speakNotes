# speakNotes
**speakNotes** allows you to use your classical Notepad in a modern futuristic way. It allows you to **speak out your thoughts onto your notepad instead of typing it**, hence allowing a free flow of thought and greater human-computer interaction.
It also allows you to **convert an audio file into text**, and **vice versa**.
